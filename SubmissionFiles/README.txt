You will need to download unity to properly view and run the source code for our project.

Open the project, then on the right hand of the screen there should be a list of objects in the environment such as the interaction manager, various dice models, GUI elements, and more. For each object, on the left side is a list of components of that object. In some of these lists are attached scripts which is the code created for our project, though the brunt of the work which we were able to complete was the creation and configuration of various objects and integration of those objects with eachother and with the LEAPMotion technology.

To execute the source code, click the run button at the top of the editor. This will switch your scene viewer pane to the game pane in which you can interact with the project.

While using the project, press spacebar to reset or roll dice. Reset dice hover (often out of sight), so it is often desirable to immediately roll reset dice. Use your hand motions to bump or grab dice (forming a fist or 3-finger pinching motion to grab dice). The GUI remains unimplemented.
